# LSUN extractors
A useful script to extract data from LSUN datasets. It allows to extract only a subset of database, 
set jpg quality of output images and process data files efficiently to avoid huge RAM usage. 
For more details see file `lsun_scripts.py`.

Data can be downloaded from the official web page: https://www.yf.io/p/lsun

Base repo to process LSUN data: https://github.com/fyu/lsun

Inspired by a script `dataset_tool.py` from StyleGAN repo: https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan/blob/master/dataset_tool.py

PyTorch code to parse LSUN databases: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/_modules/torchvision/datasets/lsun.html
